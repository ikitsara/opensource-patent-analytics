The powerpoint from today is in the presentations folder to help you. But, note that you will need some additional skills.  

1. These files are .gexf network files. To load then into gephi choose File -> Open Graph File and then keep clicking OK

2. When working with these files use ranking panel and records to size the nodes. You will need to find the right icon in the Ranking panel

3. There are a large number of nodes in the inventors and the pizza_phrases file. You may need to look in Context - Filters _ Range to identify a filter to drop onto the sliding scale at the bottom. Experiment with the lower value until you see a more or less clean graph that communicates information without being overwhelming or too sparse. 

4. For the applicants_parsed file you will need to look in the Data Laboratory and right click to select the appropriate option for dealing with the NA (Not available) node that dominates the view. Go to Ranking to resize the nodes when you find the best option. 

5. DO NOT FORGET to save your work with save as and the .gephi extension or all your work will be lost. Save often as you move towards a final graph.
